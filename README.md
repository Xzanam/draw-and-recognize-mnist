# draw-and-recognize-mnist
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It features a terminal-based interface that allows users to draw digits in real time using their mouse. The drawn digit is then processed and classified by the CNN model.
