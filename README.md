# Draw-and-Recognize-MNIST

This project implements a Simple Feed Forward Neural Network and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The project includes a terminal-based interface that allows users to draw digits in real time using their mouse. Once a digit is drawn, it is processed and classified by the trained model.

## Requirements

### For Training the Model
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - PyTorch
  - torchvision
  - tqdm
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - jupyter

### For Running the Interface
- g++ or clang (C++11 or later)
- LibTorch (PyTorch C++ API)
- ncurses library
- cmake

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Xzanam/draw-and-recognize-mnist.git
    cd draw-and-recognize-mnist
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages**:

## Training the Model

The training code is provided in `mnist.ipynb`. Follow these steps:

1. **Open the notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook mnist.ipynb
    ```

2. **Run the cells** to train the model on the MNIST dataset. mnist.ipynb consists of training code for both Feed Forward Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network. The notebook itself is self-explanatory. After training, the model is exported as 'model_cnn.pt' using PyTorch's JIT.

## Compiling the C++ interface

To compile the C++ interface, follow these steps:

1. **Create a build directory**:
   Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder. Create a separate directory for the build files to keep things organized:
   
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

2. **Run CMake**:
   Use CMake to generate the necessary build files. Make sure you are inside the `build` directory:

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

3. **Compile the code**:
   Now, compile the code using `make`:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

After these steps, an executable named `character_recog` should be created in the `build` directory, ready to run with your trained model.

## Running the Interface
Launch the application with:

```bash
./character_recog <path_to_the_trained_model>
```
In my case 

```bash
./character_recog ../mnist_CNN.pt
```

### Instructions

- **Draw**: Use your mouse to draw a digit directly in the terminal.
- **Predict**: Press `p` to classify the drawn digit.
- **Clear**: Press `c` to erase the current drawing and start over.
- **Quit**: Press `q` to exit the application.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

1. **libtorch.so: No such file or directory**
   - This error usually indicates that LibTorch is not installed or the paths provided during compilation are incorrect.
   - **Solution**: Verify that LibTorch is installed, and make sure the paths to the LibTorch headers and libraries are correct in the compilation command.

2. **Mouse not working**
   - If the mouse input is not functioning as expected, it might be due to a missing or incompatible `ncurses` installation.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that `ncurses` is properly installed on your system and that your terminal supports mouse input.
